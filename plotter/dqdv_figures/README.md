> This plot shows the dV/dQ profiles of the B0047 battery over 30 discharging cycles. <br> The values gradually decrease as the cycles progress.

### Figure 3b
> **Correlation heatmap between extracted features and SOH in four datasets. The
numbers 1â€“17 represent 17 features, and feature 17 is `dV/dQ` value.**

### Figure 4a
> The SOH estimation results of proposed PINN on four datasets. If predicted and true SOH are distributed near the diagonal, it indicates that the model performs well.

### Figure 4b
> Distributions of mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean square error (RMSE) of 3 models (the proposed PINN (Ours), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and convolutional neural network (CNN)) on four datasets.

### Comparision with Original NASA data
> Compared MAE, MAPE, and RMSE of three models between the NASA dataset and the NASA_dQdV dataset.

**[Figure | MAE, MAPE, RMSE comparison of three models on NASA vs. NASA_dQdV.]** 
> The analysis shows that the dQ/dV dataset leads to higher errors (MAE, MAPE, RMSE) compared to the original NASA dataset, indicating that models perform better on the original data.
